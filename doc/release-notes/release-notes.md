# Versioning Gap Explanation (v0.59.0 - v0.67.0)

## � Missing Versions in Node-exe and Node Repositories

**Notice:** You may observe that versions 0.59.0 through 0.67.0 are not listed in the release notes below for `node-exe` and `node` repositories. This section explains why.

### What Happened During v0.59.0 - v0.67.0

Until June 2025, the Knuth project operated as **separate repositories** with independent versioning:

- **`c-api` repository**: Actively released versions 0.59.0 → 0.67.0
- **`node` repository**: Remained stable at v0.58.0 (no new releases needed)
- **`node-exe` repository**: Remained stable at v0.58.0 (no new releases needed)

### Architecture Transition: Multi-repo → Mono-repo

**Starting with v0.68.0**, the Knuth project **transitioned to a mono-repository architecture**:

- **Before**: Multiple independent repositories with separate release cycles
- **After**: Single mono-repository (`kth-mono`) with unified versioning
- **Result**: All components now share the same version number and release cycle

### Why This Change

1. **Simplified Management**: Single repository, single version, single release process
2. **Improved Coordination**: All components evolve together with consistent versioning
3. **Better Developer Experience**: One codebase, one build system, one release cycle
4. **Easier Dependency Management**: No more version compatibility matrices between repos

### C-API Releases During Multi-repo Period

The following versions were released **only for the C-API repository** before the mono-repo transition:

| Version | Release Date | Key Changes |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| v0.67.0 | June 2025    | 2025-may post upgrade changes |
| v0.66.0 | May 2025     | General improvements |
| v0.65.0 | May 2025     | Maintenance updates |
| v0.64.0 | May 2025     | Better logging functionality |
| v0.63.0 | May 2025     | Domain objects deserialization refactor |
| v0.62.0 | April 2025   | VM improvements + Ubuntu 24.04 support |
| v0.61.0 | February 2025| VM restoration and enhancements |
| v0.60.0 | January 2025 | Build improvements |
| v0.59.0 | December 2024| Extended build info and VM features |

### Historical Reference

For complete release notes from the multi-repo era, see:
- [C-API Release History](https://github.com/k-nuth/c-api/releases)
- [Node Release History](https://github.com/k-nuth/node/releases)
- [Node-exe Release History](https://github.com/k-nuth/node-exe/releases)

### Moving Forward

**Starting with v0.68.0**: All development happens in the mono-repository with unified versioning. This eliminates version gaps and ensures all components are released together with coordinated changes.

This release includes the following features and fixes:

- Knuth's build system ([kthbuild](https://github.com/k-nuth/kthbuild)) has been completely rewritten.
For x86-64 systems (AMD, Intel, etc.) kthbuild now supports all five industry-defined [microarchitecture levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels): x86-64-v0, x86-64-v1, x86-64-v2, x86-64-v3, and x86-64-v4
This version of node has been compiled using kthbuild v1.0.37.
We have chosen to distribute binaries compiled using the x86-64-v3 microarchitecture level.
However, if your platform does not support the x86-64-v3 microarchitecture level, kthbuild will automatically compile from source using your platform's specifications.
And if your platform is better than x86-64-v3, you can take advantage of your hardware by compiling node with `-o march_strategy=optimize`.
- Uses C++ API v0.25.0
- Support for Visual Studio (MSVC) has been temporarily discontinued.
- Some external dependencies were updated.

# Versioning History Note (v0.59.0 - v0.67.0)

## 📝 Missing Versions Explanation

**Important:** You may notice that versions 0.59.0 through 0.67.0 are not listed above for `node-exe` and `node` repositories. This is intentional and explained below.

### What Happened During v0.59.0 - v0.67.0

During this period (December 2024 - May 2025), the Knuth project used **different versioning schemes** across repositories:

- **`c-api` repository**: Continued releasing versions 0.59.0 → 0.67.0 with active development
- **`node` and `node-exe` repositories**: Remained at v0.58.0 with no new releases

### Why This Happened

1. **Development Focus**: Most active development occurred in the C-API layer
2. **Stable Core**: The C++ node library and executable were stable and didn't require updates
3. **API Evolution**: The C-API needed frequent updates for new features and improvements
4. **Independent Releases**: Each repository was released independently based on actual changes

### C-API Versions During This Period

The following versions were released **only for the C-API repository**:

| Version | Release Date | Key Changes |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| v0.67.0 | June 2025    | 2025-may post upgrade changes |
| v0.66.0 | May 2025     | (Release notes available in c-api repo) |
| v0.65.0 | May 2025     | (Release notes available in c-api repo) |
| v0.64.0 | May 2025     | Better logs and logging fixes |
| v0.63.0 | May 2025     | Domain objects deserialization refactor |
| v0.62.0 | April 2025   | VM improvements and Ubuntu 24.04 support |
| v0.61.0 | February 2025| Partial restore of Knuth VM and improvements |
| v0.60.0 | January 2025 | (Release notes available in c-api repo) |
| v0.59.0 | December 2024| Build info extensions and VM features |
| v0.58.0 | December 2024| VM API extensions |

### For Detailed Information

- [C-API Release History](https://github.com/k-nuth/c-api/releases)

### Moving Forward

Starting with **v0.68.0**, all repositories use unified versioning to avoid this confusion and ensure clear version correspondence across all components.
